## Agent sandbox

A **smolagents** crew running on Gemini via Google's `google-genai` SDK
(Vertex API key, Vertex service account, or the Gemini API), backed by
**Google Earth Engine** for compute. Forked from
[natcap/ee-agent-sandbox](../ee-agent-sandbox)'s infra.

### The crew

- **Orchestrator** — evaluates the prompt, picks whichever geospatial model
  tool(s) fit (auto-loaded from `tools/models/`), calls them (or writes ad hoc
  `ee` code directly), and reports the result.
- **Researcher** — sub-agent for a fact Earth Engine can't supply (an official
  date/status, a disputed statistic) via web search + page fetch.

A model tool computes over Earth Engine and publishes its result to a shared
**results board** (`natcap_agents/results.py`) — a map layer and/or a
stats-table row — as a side effect, rather than through the final-answer text.
The marimo app reads that board to draw the map and table. `tools/models/`
holds the project's own models (`example_forest_loss.py` is a working
template — swap it for the real 5); tools a Tool Smith agent forges land in
`tools/generated/` instead (see `forge.py`) and are auto-loaded the same way.

**Regions stay server-side.** A place name resolves via `resolve_region()`
(`natcap_agents/regions.py`) to a short `region_id` — the orchestrator never
pulls a boundary's coordinates back into its own context (a country/park
polygon can be thousands of points, which would bloat every later turn). Every
tool that takes a `region` accepts that `region_id`, or a plain
`'west,south,east,north'` bounding box — nothing bulkier.

**Dataset search has exactly two sources**: `search_full_catalog` (Google's
official EE Data Catalog) and `search_community_catalog`
([gee-community-catalog.org](https://gee-community-catalog.org/about/), mostly
`projects/sat-io/...` assets). `researcher`'s web search is for external facts
only, never for finding datasets.

### App

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
marimo run notebooks/app.py       # read-only app view
# or: marimo edit notebooks/app.py   # to edit cells / the layout
```

Type a prompt, click **Run crew**, and watch: a rolling "thinking" log in the
side column streams each plan/step/tool-call as the crew works, while the
central map and the stats table below it fill in once the run's model tool(s)
report their layers/stats. The dashboard arrangement lives in
`notebooks/layouts/app.grid.json`.

### Energy use

The **Energy** panel under the stats table shows the electricity this session
has used: one row per run (plus setup), and a session total, refreshed after
each run. It reads Apple Silicon's cumulative energy counters for the CPU,
GPU, Neural Engine and DRAM (what `powermetrics` reports, but via IOReport,
so no sudo), which makes each run's figure exact rather than sampled. Other
apps running at the same time are included, so **above idle** subtracts the
average draw measured between runs; with a local backend such as Ollama that
difference is mostly inference. Not counted: the display, SSD, Wi-Fi, charger
losses, and anything on Google's servers (Gemini, Earth Engine). On Intel
Macs and Linux there are no counters to read: `measure()` becomes a no-op and
the panel shows a warning instead. Outside the app:

```python
from natcap_agents import energy
meter = energy.session_meter()
with meter.measure("forest loss") as run:
    crew.run("How much forest was lost in <region> since 2015?")
print(f"{run.energy_wh:.2f} Wh, session {meter.session_wh:.2f} Wh")
```

### Setup

```bash
./setup.sh
$EDITOR .env                     # project id, EE service account, model backend/API key
source .venv/bin/activate
marimo run notebooks/app.py
```

You need a GCP project with the **Vertex AI** and **Earth Engine** APIs
enabled and the project **registered for Earth Engine**. Whoever authenticates
— a service account or your own user account — needs
`roles/earthengine.writer` + `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer` (add
`roles/aiplatform.user` only if the models use that same identity).

### Earth Engine auth (`.env`)

Two credentials work, and `init_earth_engine()` picks between them by looking
at what is actually on disk:

- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` names a key file **that exists** → that
  service-account key (paired with `EE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`).
- otherwise → **Application Default Credentials**. On a laptop, run once:
  ```bash
  gcloud auth application-default login --project $GCP_PROJECT_ID
  ```
  On a GCE VM / Cloud Run / Colab there is nothing to run — the attached
  service account already *is* the ADC, so leave both `.env` lines blank.

A key path that points at a missing file does not raise: the variable is
dropped (a stale one makes google-auth fail instead of falling back to ADC)
and ADC is used, with the path mentioned if initialization then fails.
`ee.Authenticate()` is never called — it opens a browser and would hang a
headless run.

### Model auth (`.env`)

The models use, in order:

- `VERTEX_API_KEY` set → Vertex **Express mode** with that key (no service
  account needed for the models).
- else `LLM_BACKEND=gemini` + `GEMINI_API_KEY` → Gemini Developer API.
- else → Vertex via the same credential Earth Engine uses (service-account key
  if present, otherwise ADC).

"""Assemble the natcap geospatial crew on Gemini (via google-genai) or Ollama.

    Orchestrator (manager CodeAgent)
      └─ Researcher (ToolCallingAgent) — external facts via web search

The orchestrator evaluates the prompt and calls whichever geospatial model
tool(s) fit (auto-loaded from `tools/models/` — see project_tools.py), plus
generic Earth Engine catalog/compute helpers, directly: no delegation needed
for that part, since it's itself a CodeAgent that can call tools or write ad
hoc `ee` code in the same step. Model tools publish their results to the
shared `results` board (map layers + stats rows) as a side effect; the marimo
app in notebooks/app.py reads that board after each run to build the map and
stats table.

Usage:
    from natcap_agents.auth import bootstrap
    from natcap_agents.agents import build_crew
    from natcap_agents import results
    bootstrap()
    crew = build_crew()
    results.reset()
    crew.run("How much forest was lost in <region> since 2015?")
